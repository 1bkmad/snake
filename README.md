# snake
This project contains the python code for famous snake game, using Python's Turtle Lib.
In this project I have used python's Turtle Module and the OOPs concept. The whole project is divided into 4 files to make the code more readable.

  - Contains functions related to setting up environment ( like screen color, size, title etc.)

  - Code for extension of snake when it touches the food.
  - Snake's movement as well as bindigs with different key strokes.
